    "# RESOLVE Data Tutorial\n",
    "This jupyter notebook illustrates use of the public RESOLVE (REsolved Spectroscopy Of a Local VolumE) survey database, including HI upper limit and confusion information. As of this writing, the HI mass census is fully available (Stark et al. 2016), but HI profile metrics are still being analyzed. The optical spectroscopic census is ~70% complete and is still being reduced and analyzed.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the RESOLVE catalog and all calculations below assume H_0 = 70 km/s/Mpc, implying a combined volume for RESOLVE-A and RESOLVE-B of 52,135 cubic Mpc.<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The RESOLVE website at http://resolve.astro.unc.edu/ provides further information, data, and links to papers as well as details on the ECO (Environmental COntext) catalog. ECO is a nearly ten times larger data set surrounding RESOLVE with comparable photometric and environmental data, but it has no new radio or optical spectroscopy beyond SDSS/ALFALFA. A follow-up tutorial demonstrating the use of ECO to correct for cosmic variance in RESOLVE (in the spirit of Eckert et al. 2016) will be provided soon, along with a forthcoming analysis of the bivariate HI mass function comparing RESOLVE and the Simba simulation (Kannappan, Dave, Eckert, et al., in prep.) -- check for updates at the RESOLVE website!\n",

    "The RESOLVE database includes galaxies that are not officially part of the survey. They may either have redshifts in the buffer range used for group-finding or have magnitudes fainter than the survey luminosity floor. In some cases data for these galaxies may be useful, but please do not expect all of it to be carefully vetted. We recommend working with one of the following sample definitions to isolate complete, high-quality data sets:<br/><br/>\n",

    "2) the observational sample (for new 21cm and optical spectroscopy): same as #1, but adding in galaxies with known or estimated log(M\\*+1.4MHI)> 9.2 (A-semester) or 9.0 (B-semester) <br/>\n",
    "3) the baryonic mass complete sample: Grpcz between 4500-7000 km/s and log Mbary> 9.2 (A-semester) or 9.0 (B-semester), where Mbary = (M\\*+1.4MHI)<br/>\n",
