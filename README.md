 * close open tabs in the Lab (not necessary, just less confusing)
 * check that a python kernel is connected. If the upper right-corner of the notebook says "No Kernel", go to `Kernel` > `Change Kernel` and select `Pyolite` (it should now read "Pyolite" in the corner).
 * obtain the tutorial: `File` > `Open from URL` > copy+paste `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/resolvesurvey/database-tutorial/master/RESOLVE_DataTutorial.ipynb`.
